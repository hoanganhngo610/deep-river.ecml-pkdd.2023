# Practical information

The agenda of the tutorial will be as follows:

* **Place**: Polytechnico di Torino
* **Time**: Friday, September 22nd 2023, afternoon (GMT+1)

# Abstract

Online clustering algorithms play a critical role in data science, especially with the advantages regarding time, memory usage and complexity, while maintaining a high performance compared to traditional clustering methods. This tutorial serves, first, as a survey on online machine learning and, in particular, data stream clustering methods. During this tutorial, state-of-the-art algorithms and the associated core research threads will be presented by identifying different categories based on distance, density grids and hidden statistical models. Clustering validity indices, an important part of the clustering process which are usually neglected or replaced with classification metrics, resulting in misleading interpretation of final results, will also be deeply investigated.

Then, this introduction will be put into the context with River, a go-to Python library merged between `Creme` and `scikit-multiflow`. It is also the first open-source project to include an online clustering module that can facilitate reproducibility and allow direct further improvements. From this, we propose methods of clustering configuration, applications and settings for benchmarking, using real-world problems and datasets.

# Outline including a short summary of every section

The outline of the tutorial, which expands along the period of **3 hours** (half-day), is as follows:

* Introduction to data stream (online) machine learning (approximately **45 minutes**)

  - What is online machine learning, and why do we need online machine learning?
  - Differences, advantages and disadvantages of online machine learning compared to batch/traditional machine learning.
  - Introduction to River, a hands-on Python library for machine learning merged from `Creme` and `scikit-multiflow`.
  - Practical applications of `River` in classification, concept drifts, implementation of estimators, etc. and displaying real-time results using `holoviews`.

* Online clustering algorithms and evaluation metrics (approximately **1 hour and 30 minutes**):

  - A literature survey on existing clustering algorithms, the general concepts and their evolution.
  - Primary differences between clustering and classification evaluation metrics, which might lead to wrong interpretation of final results.
  - Real-world applications of online clustering algorithms and evaluation metrics in practical problems.

* Use cases and benchmarking (approximately **45 minutes**):

  - Comparison between online and traditional/batch clustering algorithms.
  - Motivation, setting and system requirements for conducting benchmarking.
  - Tutorial on benchmarking using the `River` package and the associated available `git` repository and `terminal`.

## Introduction to data stream (online) machine learning

This part is intended to provide the motivation and necessity of online stream learning. As a matter of fact, traditional machine learning methods can not deal with an extremely large amount of data with limited resources and time constrains, which means that there is an urgent need for specific data stream machine learning methods. Besides providing insights on advantages and disadvantages of online machine learning, we will also provide an introduction to `River`, a Python library aimed to become a go-to toolkit for this purpose.

## A literature survey on online clustering algorithms and metrics

This part will first start with an extensive survey on online clustering algorithms. First, we will start with the development from the first algorithms (`BIRCH`/`CluStream`), then to the evolution based on different approaches. These approaches include either distance-based, grid-based, model-based or projected, two-phase, type of time windows (damped, sliding, landmark or pyramidal), or the use of medoids/centroids.

Moreover, one aspect of online clustering algorithms that are usually neglected are the usages of validation metrics. Usually, classification metrics are used as a replacement, which may lead to the wrong interpretation of final results and the choice of hyperparameters. As such, in this part, we will also focus on the construction of these metrics, and also how to apply them in analyzing clustering algorithms' performances when put into practice.

## Practical applications and benchmarking using the clustering module of River

The final part serves as a practical tutorial on the usage of River and the associated clustering module in real-life problems. First, online clustering algorithms will be put into comparison with traditional/batch methods in terms of performance, memory and time usage to prove that although online methods takes up less resources, they have the ability to obtain a similar accuracy. Then, the setting, system requirement and method of benchmarking and choosing the appropriate hyperparameter sets are discussed.

# Specific goals and objectives

The specific goal of this tutorial is to act as a literature survey and an introduction to online clustering algorithms, metrics and their recent advances through `River` - an existing Python online machine learning library. Through that, it also provides all necessary tools and techniques, as a framework, to apply online clustering algorithms in real-world scenarios and to develop practical applications in line with its theoretical background.

* Present an introduction on online machine learning and its advantages compared to traditional/batch machine learning.
* Provide core theoretical background to understand how clustering algorithms and methods are designed.
* Introduce `River` as a new, go-to library/framework for building online machine learning algorithms.
* Give practical examples and insights on how to use River in real-life applications and benchmarking.
* Discuss the past, present, future challenges and future challenges and how researchers have been tackling those in their algorithms' development.

# Expected background of the audience

The target audience of this tutorial include any researchers and practitioners with interests on machine learning for big data/evolving data streams and/or IoT applications. There will be no special requirement on previous experience on data stream learning; however, either experience with traditional machine learning concepts and frameworks (`scikit-learn`, `keras`, `pytorch`, etc.) or previous interactions with `scikit-multiflow`, `Creme` or `River` (the merge of the two) is a plus.
